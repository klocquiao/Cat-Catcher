    <string name="about_text">Kyle Locquiao is an SFU undergraduate in the Software Systems program. Cat Catcher was independently developed
        for <a href="https://opencoursehub.cs.sfu.ca/bfraser/grav-cms/cmpt276/home/">CMPT 276 D2 (Fall 2021)</a>.
        Cat Catcher is a game that involves finding cats to win. Upon starting a game, the user is presented
        with a field of cells. By tapping one of these cells, the user will either discover a cat or will be given clues as to how many cats their are
        in that cells row and column. Once the counter on the top left is equal to the max amount of cats on the field, the user will be congratulated
        and the game will end. The user can control the amount of rows and columns on the field, as well as the number of cats, by accessing the settings
        for the main menu. </string>
